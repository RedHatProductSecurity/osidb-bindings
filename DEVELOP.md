Instructions how to contribute to and release osidb-bindings

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required for development and deployment:
* make
* python3
* python3 dependencies (see [pip-tools](#using-pip-tools))
* tox

## Development

### Using pip-tools
OSIDB bindings has adopted `pip-tools` as its tool of choice for python dependency management,
in this section we'll go over the basics, the similarities and the differences between `pip-tools` and `pip`,
as well as how to use it effectively.

With `pip`, adding a dependency is as simple as adding it to the `requirements.txt`,
and optionally choosing which version(s) to use.

With `pip-tools`, the dependency (versioned or not) is added to either `requirements.in`,
`devel-requirements.in` or `local-requirements.in`, then we must execute the `pip-compile`
command in order to generate the corresponding `*-requirements.txt`.

```bash
$ pip-compile --generate-hashes --allow-unsafe	# this will compile requirements.in -> requirements.txt
$ pip-compile --generate-hashes --allow-unsafe devel-requirements.in	# be explicit for alternate requirements files
```

Instead of typing these commands manually you can simply do

```bash
$ make compile-deps
```

and all the necessary `requirements.txt` files will be compiled correctly.

So far the differences between the two are minimal, both use a `requirements.txt` file to express its dependencies, however the dependency tree generated by `pip-compile` is more thorough, it will include all implicit dependencies of the ones explicitly defined in the `*.in` files and will pin them to a very specific version.
Not only does this make it easier to reproduce prod/dev environments, but it can also be helpful for later security vulnerabilities scanning.

Note that if any dependencies are added to the `*.in` files, and then `pip-compile` is ran, the versions of the existing pinned dependencies will not change and only the new dependencies will be added to the `requirements.txt`

Updating dependencies with `pip` and `pip-tools` is largely the same, the command for doing so with `pip-tools` is the following

```bash
$ pip-compile --generate-hashes --allow-unsafe --upgrade-package django --upgrade-package requests==2.0.0
```

To install the dependencies with `pip`, you simply pass the requirements file(s) to the `-r` option and all the requirements in the file will be installed, even if the file was generated by `pip-compile`!

With `pip-tools`, the command for installing dependencies is `pip-sync requirements.txt` (or any other file generated by `pip-compile`), however `pip-sync` will not only install the requirements, but it will also uninstall any packages or versions that do **not** match the one defined in the requirements file.

If installing multiple requirements files, they can simply be passed as additional positional arguments to `pip-sync`

```bash
$ pip-sync requirements.txt devel-requirements.txt local-requirements.txt
```

Instead of running this command manually, you can also use

```bash
$ make sync-deps
```

> :warning: Make sure to run `pip-sync` within a virtual environment, otherwise you risk having system-wide packages that are not in the `requirements.txt` be uninstalled

As for what each requirements file holds, here's a quick explanation for each:
- `requirements.txt`: dependencies necessary for running OSIDB bindings
- `devel-requirements.txt`: dependencies necessary to develop OSIDB bindings
- `local-requirements.txt`: dependencies specific to your workflow (e.g. `ipython` or any other custom shell/debugger)

`local-requirements.txt` is a special case, it is ignored in the `.gitignore` because it's specific to every developer. Without it, every time `pip-sync` is ran any packages specific to your workflow would be uninstalled and would have to be manually installed.

When synchronizing multiple requirements files, it is important that every subsequent requirements files "includes" the previous one, e.g.:

```
# requirements.in
httpx
```

```
# devel-requirements.in
-c requirements.txt
pytest
```

```
# local-requirements.in
-c devel-requirements.txt
ipython
```

This is so `pip-sync` can properly synchronize the versions of dependencies that appear in all the requirements files.

### OpenAPI Python Client
OSIDB bindings are built as a wrapper around the autogenerated python client.
We use [openapi-python-client](https://github.com/openapi-generators/openapi-python-client) python package
which is capable of generating the python client from OpenAPI schema. We generate the python client (`osidb_bindings/bindings` folder) from schema (`osidb_bindings/openapi_schema.yml`) and then we use the generated client in the bindings wrapper to hide all uncessary technical stuff for user.

Since the client is not perfect the way it is generated we use a handy [template mechanism](https://github.com/openapi-generators/openapi-python-client#using-custom-templates) offered by the package which is based on [Jinja templating](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/). This way, we are able to define our own Jinja templates in `osidb_bindings/templates` which
replaces the original templates from the [openapi-python-client](https://github.com/openapi-generators/openapi-python-client) repository. There is drawback in usage of these template, because the templating API is in beta version on not yet stable and thus the version of `openapi-python-client` is precisely locked via [pip-tools](#using-pip-tools) and should not be updated unless the templates are adjusted to a new version.

#### Client create/update

* To generate a fresh new bindings python client you can use:
    ```
    $ make create
    ```
    Note: this won't work when `osidb_bindings/bindings` folder exists. Folder needs to be deleted first.


* To update the current bindings python client from updated schema file use:
    ```
    $ make update
    ```

### Feature commit

1) Create feature branch

2) Check commit is clean by running

    ```
    $ tox
    ```

3) Run tests locally

    ```
    $ tox -e unit-tests
    ```

4) Update [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) in case of some breaking changes
   which affects the user

7) raise PR against master ensuring good title/description and bullet point
   all significant commits

## Release

There are two main cases when this package needs to be released.

### Version policy

OSIDB bindings as well as the OSIDB itself uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) (eg. MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, 1.2.3),
however there are some extra rules for the bindings versioning to keep bindings and OSIDB in sync.

* MAJOR and MINOR versions - these versions are only incremented based on the OSIDB version and shouldn't be incremented
when some changes or fixes happens only on the side of the bindings. Whenever the MAJOR or MINOR version of OSIDB gets
released, bindings should be regenerated and accomodated for that version and then released with the same version number.
Eg. OSIDB is on version 1.2.0, bindings are on version 1.2.0 as well, OSIDB 1.3.0 gets released, necessary changes are made
on the bindings side and bindings 1.3.0 gets released as well.

* PATCH version - this version part is separated from OSIDB and it is used mainly for introducing fixes and changes only on
bindings side. Whenever there is a fix or some change in the code that needs to be released however has nothing to do with
the OSIDB itself, the PATCH version gets incremented. Eg. Bindings are on version 1.2.0, bug is found in the bindings code,
bug gets fixed and bindings 1.2.1 are released.

Based on these rules, OSIDB and OSIDB bindings are always compatible as long as the MAJOR and MINOR version matches.
* OSIDB 1.2.0, bindings 1.2.0 - compatible
* OSIDB 1.2.0, bindings 1.2.1 - compatible
* OSIDB 1.2.2, bindings 1.2.1 - compatible
* OSIDB 1.3.0, bindings 1.2.1 - **feature incomplete**
* OSIDB 2.0.0, bindings 1.9.9 - **incompatible**

### Patch release

When minor changes needs to be done on the osidb-bindings side without the actual release of the OSIDB itself
patch release is prefered.

1) Make your changes (see [how to feature commit](feature-commit))

2) Clone/update master branch

    ```
    $ git checkout master
    $ git pull
    ```

3) Start release script and follow instructions

    ```
    $ make patch-release
    ```

    This will:
    * create a new branch
    * increment the patch part of the version in all necessary places (eg. x.x.1 -> x.x.2)
    * commit and push the changes
    * open pull request creation in browser

4) Confirm PR creation opened by the relase script

5) Confirm checks passes

6) Merge PR

7) Create a new release and tag via [GitHub WebUI](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/osidb-bindings/releases/new) - this will also trigger the build and upload to PyPI
    * Tag and release needs be in format x.x.x to comply with [semantic versioning](#version-policy)
    * Tag needs to point to the latest commit
    * Release description should include the newest section of the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
    ```

### Release with OSIDB

When new major/minor OSIDB version is released, major/minor release of the osidb-bindings needs to be performed.

1) Clone/update master branch

    ```
    $ git checkout master
    $ git pull
    ```

2) Start release script and follow instructions

    ```
    $ make release
    ```

    This will:
    * compare latest version of OSIDB and bindings (safe check before release)
    * download OpenAPI schema of latest OSIDB version
    * create a new branch
    * regenerate bindings
    * replace version on all places with new OSIDB bindings based on the latest OSIDB version
    * commit and push the changes
    * open pull request creation in browser

3) Confirm PR creation opened by the relase script

4) Confirm checks passes

5) Merge PR

6) Create a new release and tag via [GitHub WebUI](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/osidb-bindings/releases/new) - this will also trigger the build and upload to PyPI
    * Tag and release needs be in format x.x.x to comply with [semantic versioning](#version-policy)
    * Tag needs to point to the latest commit
    * Release description should include the newest section of the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
